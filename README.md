# RestaurantRecommendation
Restaurant Recommendation Engine

Here I have used chain of responsibility design pattern in order to get restaurants recommendations.
One of the main advantages of using chain of responsibility design pattern is extensibility of your code, moreover, 
in future if we want to change the priority of rules via which we want to recommend, it can be done with minimal changes.
Apart from this MVC architecture pattern is used and SOLID principles are being followed.
